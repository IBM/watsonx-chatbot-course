## 2. Download or clone the repo

Download the repo so that you can have code for reference. So let's get that done early on, you'll need [`git`](https://git-scm.com) on your laptop to clone the repository directly, or access to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to download the zip file.


Alternately, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/watsonx-chatbot-lab
cd watsonx-chatbot-lab
```
