## 2. Download or clone the repo

Download the repo so that you can have it for local reference. So let's get that done early on. You'll need [`git`](https://git-scm.com) on your laptop to clone the repository directly, or access to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to download the [zip file](https://github.com/IBM/watsonx-chatbot-lab/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

To clone the repo, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/watsonx-chatbot-lab
cd watsonx-chatbot-lab
```
